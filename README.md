-It was developed for HackinUTA (National Level Hackathon organised by Uka Tarsadia University) https://hackinutu-28cbf.web.app/

When you are out on a long vacation, your plants gets unmoist and when you return they are low on moisture level. This project can help the soil moisture sensors to continuously sense the water level in the plants. The moisture level can be tracked via android application. When the moisture or water level drops a certain level the android application pops up a warning message with an option to start water supply to the soil.
